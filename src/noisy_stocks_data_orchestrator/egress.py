    # Today, $yearcount years ago, the chart for $stock went $direction. What could have caused it? There could be a billion good reasons. We at NoisyStocks have no idea what those reasons are. Perhaps it was the weather, the phase of the moon, or the stance of the planets. We calculated our chart using a special "throw-spaghetti-at-a-wall-and-see-what-sticks" algorithm. Our tried-and-failed approach takes random variables and makes wildly spurious correlations.
